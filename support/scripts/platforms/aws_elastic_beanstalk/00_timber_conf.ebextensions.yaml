# Example Elastic Beanstalk configuration for Timber's configuration file
#
# This is an example file that writes out the Timber configuration file for the
# log collection agent. Start by copying it into the `.ebextensions` directory
# in your project folder. Make sure that it is named so that it will be sorted
# _before_ the file that installs the Timber agent (prefixing it with a number
# like `00_` does the trick). You'll then need to edit the `content` key to fit
# your needs.
#
# The example shown here is for a NodeJS application being run behind
# an nginx proxy. By default, Elastic Beanstalk will redirect the STDOUT for
# your application to a log file, so you just need to locate the name of this
# file for the platform stack you are using.
